This module defines a number of basic node and mark types. First, the
node types:

@Doc
@BlockQuote
@HorizontalRule
@Heading
@CodeBlock
@Paragraph
@Image
@HardBreak

And some basic mark types:

@EmMark
@StrongMark
@LinkMark
@CodeMark

The prebuilt schema that combines these nodes and marks can be used
directly, used as a base, or ignored altogether, if you just want to
pick and choose some of the building blocks from this module.
